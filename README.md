## Features

### Task Management
- Create, update, and delete tasks via an intuitive modal form
- Tasks contain a title, description, status, summary, due date, and priority

### Drag-and-Drop Columns
- Move tasks across **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**
- DnD Kit enables smooth and responsive drag experience

### Priority Sorting
- Tasks are color-coded and sorted by priority: High (ðŸ”´), Medium (ðŸŸ¡), Low (ðŸŸ¢)
- Priority badges provide quick visual cues

### Due Date Management
- Select due dates using a calendar picker
- Tasks automatically display **Overdue** status
- Tasks are sorted secondarily by due date (after priority)

### Filtering Tools
- Filter tasks by keyword (title or description)
- Filter by priority: All, High, Medium, Low
- Filter by date: All, Due Today, Overdue

### Real-Time Collaboration
- Updates are broadcast to all connected clients using Socket.IO
- Dragging a task updates other user views in real time

### User Authentication
- Register and login via secure JWT-based authentication
- User session is persisted and protects `/dashboard` routes

### AI-Powered Task Summary (OpenAI Integration)
- On task creation, a brief summary is generated using the OpenAI API
- Helps condense verbose descriptions for quick scanning
- Uses your own OpenAI key for flexible, secure integration
